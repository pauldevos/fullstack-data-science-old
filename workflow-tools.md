One of the most important things you can do is settle on your tools instead of trying to learn them all and learn all the new ones every time a new one comes out -- you'll be chasing the wind and you won't become as efficient as you need to be to get a Sr level job. In my opinion you should choose Python if you ever plan on publishing your content to the web or will be working in a cloud environment as the tools that support that sort of workflow are so in favor of Python. Python is THE tool of the cloud and for quickly prototyping POC level web apps (using Flask). That's where it really shines. R is best if you want quick and dirty statistical testing. It has a lot of very easy functions to output all the statistical tests on your data. This is why I think it's easier to learn after the fact as you can basically just have a cheat sheet and those couple libraries to perform those quick tests on your data as needed. But Python will be your main workhorse as well as it's Scientific libraries of Numpy, Pandas, and Scikit-Learn. Pandas has some built in data visualizations but you'll also have to get comfortable with a few other tools, such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Dash, or Bokeh to get all the visualizations you need.
